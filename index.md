There are many ways to achieve real-time content updates on the web. Long-polling, web sockets and server-side events are popular ways for real-time updates. With long-polling an HTTP request is made to the server at a predefined interval. In server-side events, the browserâ€™s event source API is used to open a channel of communication between the client and the server for updates to flow from the server to the client. The web socket protocol opens a two-way communication channel between the client and the server to allow updates to move in both ways.

This real-time chat application is built with **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)** using **[Socket.IO](https://nextjs.org/)** for demonstrations.
